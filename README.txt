-------------------
This is an expanded multi-page site (lightweight version).
- Pages: index, about, services, packages, gallery, testimonials, faq, contact, terms, privacy
- Features: responsive, lazy-loading images, minified CSS, contact form (Formspree-ready), WhatsApp booking button
- Images: logo.jpg, kaaba.jpg (background), kaaba-small.jpg (thumbnail), favicon.ico (placeholder)
- Size goal: under 200 MB (this package is tiny; real size depends on replacing images with large originals)

How to use:
1. Unzip the package.
2. Replace images/logo.jpg and images/kaaba.jpg with your high-quality images (opt for web-optimized versions to keep size low).
3. Replace FORM_HASH_ID in contact.html with your Formspree ID to receive emails.
4. Upload the folder to a static host (Netlify/GitHub Pages/Vercel) or any web server.
